'''
The return output must be this format, such as (Mode: , Parameter: , Value: ) # only return the tuple format, do not return any sentences
The mine looks like a small ball, and regular cube shape. The colour is black (normal situation), lighting and rainbow (dynamic situation when the ball is moving or hitting).

1) Mode
We have three different modes i) Grasping ii) Navigation iii) Exploration
You must select one of those modes in the tuple format at the mode part.
if (mine):
	return (Mode: Grasping, Parameter: , Value: )
else if (wall || obstacle): # if you think any stuff (Electrical equipment or things) in your front, then it is obstacle
	return (Mode: Exploration, Paramter: 2), Value: 3))
else if (empty space): # if you think you can move forward direction (without any stuff), then it is empty space
	return (Mode: Navigation, Paramter: , Value: )

2) Parameter
if (Mode == 'Exploration'):
	# infer to find more space (Left or Right) to move a robot
	if (free of space for left moving):
		Parameter = Left
		return (Mode: Exploration, Paramter: Left, Value: 3))
	else if (free of space for right moving):
		Parameter = Right
		return (Mode: Exploration, Paramter: Right, Value: 3))
	else if (Mode == 'Grasping' || 'Navigation):
		return (Mode: Grasping || Navigation, Parameter: , Value: )


3) Value
if (Mode == 'Exploration'):
	if (Parameter = 'Left'):
		Value = 90
	return (Mode: Exploration, Parameter: Left, Value: 90)
	else if (Parameter = 'Right'):
		Value = -90
	return (Mode: Exploration, Paramter: Right, Value: -90)


if the mode is Grasping or Navigation, then the outputs of parameter and value are empty
if the mode is exploration, then the output of paramter and value are required.
